# About the App
Link 22.O is an android applications aims to solve two particular problems: *lack of **digital** and **critical** literacy*.  It targets the older generations of the Philippines with regards to the spread of ***Uniform Resource Locators*** or *URLs* that may contain tons of false information. The application has two main distinct structural features to solve these two problems: ***passive*** and ***active***. 

The passive feature is designed to solve the former by identifying and categorizing the credibility of such links using recognizable colors *(from least to most credible)*: ***red***, ***yellow***, and ***green***. To use this feature, the user must copy-paste the article link to the application so that they may passively verify its credibility.

The active feature is designed to solve the latter by providing both ***reading materials*** and ***educational videos*** for the users. To use this feature, the user must click the proper section of the application for them to actively learn regarding false information.

The project integrated ***2 Google Technologies*** for the implementation of its solution: ***Flutter*** and ***Firebase***. Flutter was used to implement the front-end of the application while the Firebase was responsible for the back-end. The application uses ***card material design*** to better suit the target population. Moreover, the design is simple and easy to navigate.

# Source Code Viewing
Link 22.O was programmed using **Android Studio**. For this reason, it is recommended to use Android Studio to view the *source code* of this project as well.

## Instructions
1. Clone or download the zip file of this GitHub repository (***https://github.com/jaymordevera/link22.O.git***) to your local device.

2. In **Android Studio**, open the project (***link22_o***).

3. Locate to **main.dart** file using this relative path (***link22.O/lib/main.dart***).

5. That's it!

# Application Viewing
The application is recommended to be viewed by using 2 methods: **Android Emulator** or **Android Device**.

## By using Android Emulator
1. It is presumed that you can already view the **source code** with no significant error. Otherwise, perform the previous instructions.

2. Connect your **Android Emulator** to Android Studio; you may use ***BlueStacks 5*** or a ***Virtual Device*** installed to Android Studio itself. Just make sure you have opened the emulator first before the project in Android Studio and enabled ***Android Debug Bridge (ADB)*** from advanced settings if you opt to use the former.

3. Click the **run** button from the top-bar of Android Studio or press **Shift + F10** in your keyboard.

4. Wait for the Android Studio to view the application in the emulator.

5. That's it!

## By using Android Device
1. It is presumed that you have an android device that can run an **android package file** or **.apk**.

2. Locate the **.apk file** of the project through this relative path (***link22.O/link22O_apk/***).

3. Transfer this file to your **android device**.

4. Install the .apk file. Make sure to enable **Install Unknown Apps** from your setting.
